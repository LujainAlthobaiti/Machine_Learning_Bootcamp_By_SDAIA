This file will encompass all of my assignments throughout this camp.

# Countent:
**- Implementing a loan approval:** <br>
   
   We will investigate a dataset of loan data in this research. We'll try to make predictions about people's loan statuses based on the information.
    
**- Linear Regression for Diabetes Prediction:**  <br>
    
   In this project, we'll utilize the built-in "Diabetes" dataset from scikit-learn, which contains measures relevant to the physiological and diagnostic aspects ofÂ diabetes illness. To determine the diagnosis, it has 10 numerical characteristics.

**- Predictive Modeling using Linear Regression:** <be>
   
   In this project, we will create a linear regression model based on several factors to forecast the median house values in California. The objective is to develop an accurate prediction model that can estimate median house prices for various areas in California by examining and analyzing the dataset, conducting data cleaning and preprocessing, fitting a linear regression model, and assessing its performance.

**- Hotel Booking Data Cleaning:** <be>

  We'll make several visualizations in this project to help us examine and tidy up our dataset.

**- Estimating Insurance Expenses:** <be>

  In this project, we'll create a model to estimate a patient's treatment costs depending on their age, sex, BMI, and other factors.
